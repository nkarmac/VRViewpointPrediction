									&emsp; The emergence and rising popularity of Virtual Reality (VR) has dramatically increased the prevalence of 360 video. Looking back even just 5 years ago, VR was seen as a novelty
									unsuitable for widespread consumer use. The official release of the Oculus Rift in March of 2016 sparked the beginning of at-home consumer high-end VR, and would soon boom into a
									large market backed by various competitive companies, such as Facebook, Steam, Microsoft, Sony, and HTC.
								</p>
								<p>
									&emsp; Currently, in 2020, VR has advanced to the point that it can be used for realistic simulations such as surgery and flight training.
									However, one of the major limitations for spreading this technology is the vast increase in computational power or bandwidth
									needed to deliver the seamless 360 video which VR requires as opposed to regular 2D video. Thus, the search for video compression techniques to help alleviate has begun.
								</p>
								<p>
									&emsp; 360 video and the nature of VR allow for new compression techniques unavailable for 2D video to be possible. 
									Viewpoint prediction is one such technique that will likely cause the largest reduction out of proposed techniques thus far. 
									This project will explore various viewpoint prediction techniques.
								</p>
								<h3>What is Viewpoint Prediction</h3>
								<p>
									&emsp; Virtual Reality has a unique attribute relative to 2D video; the viewer may, at any given moment, move their head or their body which
									influences the video being shown. This makes previous 2D video motion estimation techniques hard to use due to the user's unpredictable nature.
									Viewpoint prediction is the prediction or estimation of these user movements, specifically head or body rotations, and video viewpoint rotations. The majority of user movement 
									is head rotation (looking around) which causes the viewpoint in the video to change as well. This is in contrast to 2D video where the most common movement are the
									movements of objects in the shot or panning. Optimal viewpoint prediction could reduce bandwidth consumption by as much as 80%.
